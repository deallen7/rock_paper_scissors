# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a README file.

In 2016 I enrolled in a part-time programming course focused on HTML, CSS, Ruby, Github, and learning the command line. One of the projects was to create a Rock Paper Scissors game played through the command line interface. This is what I created. I think it's rather fun and creative.

Enjoy.
